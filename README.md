# A Hybrid RAG Project on AI Workbench
This is an [NVIDIA AI Workbench](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/solutions/data-science/workbench/) project for developing a [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/) application with a customizable Gradio Chat app. It lets you:
* Embed your documents into a locally running vector database.
* Run inference **locally** on a Hugging Face TGI server, in the **cloud** using NVIDIA inference endpoints, or using **microservices** via [NVIDIA Inference Microservices (NIMs)](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/):
    * 4-bit, 8-bit, and no quantization options are supported for locally running models served by TGI.
    * Other models may be specified to run locally using their Hugging Face tag.
    * Locally-running microservice option is supported for Docker users only.

*NIMs are currently in Early Access. If you set up any accessible language model NIM running on another system, it supported for Remote NIM inference in this project. For Local NIM inference, this project provides a flow for setting up the ``mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1`` locally as an example. For advanced users, the model can be swapped out by editing the code base using additional instructions provided [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/workbench-example-hybrid-rag/blob/main/code/scripts/local-nim-configs/README.md). 

# Quickstart
This section demonstrates how to use this project to run RAG via **NVIDIA Inference Endpoints** hosted on the [NVIDIA API Catalog](https://build.nvidia.com/explore/discover). For other inference options, including local inference, see the [Advanced Tutorials](#advanced-tutorials) section for set up and instructions.

## Prerequisites
- An [NGC account](https://ngc.nvidia.com/signin) is required to generate an NVCF run key. 
- A valid NVCF key is required to access NVIDIA API endpoints. Generate a key on any NVIDIA API catalog model card, eg. [here](https://build.nvidia.com/mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct-v2) by clicking "Get API Key".

# Advanced Tutorials
This section shows you how to use different inference modes with this RAG project. For these tutorials, a GPU of at least 12 GB of vRAM is recommended. If you don't have one, go back to the [Quickstart Tutorial](#tutorial-using-a-cloud-endpoint) that shows how to use **Cloud Endpoints**. 

## Tutorial 1: Using a local GPU
This tutorial assumes you already cloned this Hybrid RAG project to your AI Workbench. If not, please follow the beginning of the [Quickstart Tutorial](#tutorial-using-a-cloud-endpoint). 

<img src="./code/chatui/static/local.gif" width="85%" height="auto">

### Additional Configurations

#### Ungated Models
The following models are _ungated_. These can be accessed, downloaded, and run locally inside the project with no additional configurations required:
* [nvidia/Llama3-ChatQA-1.5-8B](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Llama3-ChatQA-1.5-8B)

#### Gated models
Some additional configurations in AI Workbench are required to run certain listed models. Unlike the previous tutorials, these configs are not added to the project by default, so please follow the following instructions closely to ensure a proper setup. Namely, a Hugging Face API token is required for running gated models locally. [See how to create a token here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens).

The following models are _gated_. Verify that ``You have been granted access to this model`` appears on the model cards for any models you are interested in running locally:
  * [Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1)
  * [Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2)
  * [Llama-2-7b-chat-hf](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf)
  * [Llama-3-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct)

Then, complete the following steps: 
1. If the project is already running, shut down the project environment under **Environment** > **Stop Environment**. This will ensure restarting the environment will incorporate all the below configurations. 
2. In AI Workbench, add the following entries under **Environment** > **Secrets**. You should also configure the ``NVCF_RUN_KEY`` if not already done so.
   * <ins>Your Hugging Face Username</ins>: This is used to clone the model weights locally from Hugging Face.
       * _Name_: ``HUGGING_FACE_HUB_USERNAME``
       * _Value_: (Your HF Username)
       * _Description_: HF Username for cloning model weights locally
   * <ins>Your Hugging Face Token</ins>: This is used to clone the model weights locally from Hugging Face.
       * _Name_: ``HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN``
       * _Value_: (Your HF API Key)
       * _Description_: HF Token for cloning model weights locally
3. **Rebuild** the project if needed to incorporate changes.

**Note:** All subsequent tutorials will assume ``NVCF_RUN_KEY``, ``HUGGING_FACE_HUB_USERNAME``, and ``HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN`` are already configured with your credentials. 

### Inference

1. Select the green **Open Chat** button on the top right the AI Workbench project window. 
2. Once the UI opens, click **Set up RAG Backend**. This triggers a one-time backend build which can take a few moments to initialize.
3. Select the **Local System** inference mode under ``Inference Settings`` > ``Inference Mode``. 
4. Select a model from the dropdown on the right hand settings panel. Ensure you have proper access permissions for the model; instructions are [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/workbench-example-hybrid-rag?tab=readme-ov-file#additional-configurations).
    * You can also input a custom model from Hugging Face, following the same format. Careful--not all models and quantization levels may be supported in this TGI server version!
5. Select a quantization level. The recommended precision for your system will be pre-selected for you, but full, 8-bit, and 4-bit bitsandbytes precision levels are currently supported. 

##### Table 2 System Resources vs Model Size and Quantization

 | vRAM    | System RAM | Disk Storage | Model Size & Quantization |
 |---------|------------|--------------|---------------------------|
 | >=12 GB | 32 GB      | 40 GB        | 7B & int4                 |
 | >=24 GB | 64 GB      | 40 GB        | 7B & int8                 |

9. In the right hand panel of the Chat UI select **Upload Documents Here**. Click to upload or drag and drop the desired text files to upload.
   * You may see a warning that the vector database is not ready yet. If so wait a moment and try again. 
10. Once the files upload, the **Toggle to Use Vector Database** next to the text input box will turn on by default.
11. Now query your documents! To use a different model, stop the server, make your selections, and restart the inference server. 

## Tutorial 2: Using a Remote Microservice
This tutorial assumes you already cloned this Hybrid RAG project to your AI Workbench. If not, please follow the beginning of the [Quickstart Tutorial](#tutorial-using-a-cloud-endpoint). 

<img src="./code/chatui/static/remote-ms.gif" width="85%" height="auto">

### Additional Configurations

* Set up your NVIDIA NeMo Inference Microservice to run self-hosted on another system of your choice. After joining the [EA Program](https://developer.nvidia.com/nemo-microservices-early-access), the playbook to get started is located [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/docs/nemo-microservices/inference/playbooks/nmi_playbook.html). Remember the _model name_ and the _ip address_ of this running microservice. Ports for NIMs are generally set to 9999 by default.
* **Alternatively**, you may set up any other 3rd party supporting the OpenAI API Specification. One example is [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/README.md#building), as they support the [OpenAI API Spec](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/openai.md). Remember the _model name_, _port_, and the _ip address_ when you set this up. 

### Inference

8. Now you may query your documents!

## Tutorial 3: Using a Local Microservice
Spinning up a Microservice to run locally from inside this AI Workbench Hybrid RAG project is an area of active development. This tutorial has been tested on 1x Windows RTX 4090 and 2x A6000s on Ubuntu 22.04 and is currently being improved. In this tutorial, you will see how to generate a model repository for the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 model and run the NIM container for that model. Any other choice of model will require further customization of code and scripts; please see Tutorial 4 below for details. 

<img src="./code/chatui/static/local-ms.gif" width="85%" height="auto">

Here are some important **PREREQUISITES**:
* This tutorial assumes you already have this Hybrid RAG project cloned to your AI Workbench and have configured the pre-defined project secrets. If not, please first follow the first few steps of the basic [Quickstart](#quickstart). 
* Your AI Workbench <ins>must</ins> be running with a **DOCKER** container runtime. Podman is unsupported.
* You must have access to NeMo Inference Microservice (NIMs) [Early Access Program](https://developer.nvidia.com/nemo-microservices-early-access). 
* Shut down any other processes running locally on the GPU as these may result in memory issues when running the microservice locally.
