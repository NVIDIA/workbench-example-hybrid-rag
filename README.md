## Introduction
AI-griculture JM is a Jamaica-focused project built to operate as an AI-powered assistant that helps farmers and policymakers by leveraging local agricultural and environmental data.

## About
<p>
AI-griculture JM uses a <b>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</b> for allowing Jamaican farmers, agronomists, and policymakers to chat with local agricultural reports, policy documents, weather forecasts, soil data and research papers. The assistant would retrieve relevant information from these documents in real-time and 
generate meaningful responses or recommendations based on user queries.

### <b>Key Features</b>:
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Document Retrieval:</b> 
        <ul><li>Use RAG to store and retrieve a wide range of documents in a private vector             database, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Government agricultural policy documents.
                <li>Research papers on soil health, pest management, and crop growth.
                <li>Weather forecasts and historical climate data.
                <li>Local market trends and export reports for Jamaican crops.
            <ul/>
        </ul> 
        </ul>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Chat Interface:</b>
        <ul>
<li> Provide a chat interface where users can ask natural language questions (e.g., "What are the 
best practices for organic yam farming in Jamaica?" or "How will the upcoming drought 
affect coffee production?").
</li>
<li>
 RAG will retrieve relevant data from the embedded documents and generate clear, context
aware answers.
</li>
</ul>

<li>
 <b>Integration with Local Data:</b>
 <ul>
 <li>Incorporate specific data relevant to Jamaican agriculture, such as soil conditions, rainfall 
patterns, and pest outbreaks, to give personalized advice based on the farmer's location or 
crop type.
 <li>Enable farmers to upload their own reports or observations for analysis.
 </ul>
 <li><b>Recommendation System:</b>
 <ul>
 <li>Suggest optimal planting dates, crop rotations, or irrigation schedules based on retrieved 
information from research documents or environmental data.
<li>Help policymakers assess the impact of climate change on agriculture or evaluate the 
effectiveness of existing policies.
</ul>
 <li><b>Offline Capabilities:</b>
 <ul>
<li>Utilize NVIDIA AI Workbenchâ€™s offline functionality to ensure that farmers or users in 
remote areas with limited internet access can still query the assistant using locally stored 
data.
</ul>
